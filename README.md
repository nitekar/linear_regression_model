# Career Success Prediction

## Project Overview
Predict **Career success** based on  education data using machine learning models (Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest). The project includes:
1. **Modeling:** Building and comparing models to find the best performer.
2. **API Deployment:** FastAPI for prediction using the best model.
3. **Mobile App:** Flutter app for user input and prediction.
4. **Video Demo:** Showing the app and API in action.

## Dataset
The dataset contains career and education metrics, including:
- **Personal Info:** Age, Gender, Student_ID
- **Education Metrics:** High School GPA, SAT Score, University GPA
- **Career Metrics:** Job Offers, Starting Salary, Career Satisfaction
- **Skill Scores:** Soft Skills, Networking, Internships

## Modeling
1. **Data Preprocessing:** Cleaning, encoding, and splitting data.
2. **Models:**
   - **Linear Regression (Gradient Descent)**
   - **Decision Tree**
   - **Random Forest**
3. **Evaluation:** Mean Squared Error (MSE) and RÂ² score.
4. **Model Selection:** Best-performing model (Random Forest) saved as `best_model.pkl`.
