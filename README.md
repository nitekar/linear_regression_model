# Career Success Prediction

## Project Overview
Predict **Work-Life Balance** based on career and education data using machine learning models (Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest). The project includes:
1. **Modeling:** Building and comparing models to find the best performer.
2. **API Deployment:** FastAPI for prediction using the best model.
3. **Mobile App:** Flutter app for user input and prediction.
4. **Video Demo:** Showing the app and API in action.
